   # Covid-19 Help and Info

 This is a Covid-19 help website which is designed to present information on covid-19 to anybody concerned about what it is,
 looking for general advice on how to take care of themselves and others, options on how they can help and even who to contact for more info. 
 The general goal of the website is to increase the safety of the community at large by providing info in a simple and concise way from reputable sources. 


 ## Strategy
To help inform the community about the dangers of covid-19, how to take care of themselves as well others and to generally keep people up to date on covid-19.  

## scope 
The **landing page** allows the user to get to grips with the layout of the website and explains the different pages and hat they are for to the user. I hope this will help speed up the user experience especially for people who are not so comfortable with tech. Alos basic info on covid will be provided aswell as a snipit of what the world health organsiation is saying, so just a general overview. 
the **advice page** will allow the user to learn proper methods of takinig caare of themselves inclduing washing hands and what to do and not to do in this pandemic. 
the **support page** provdes two services. The frist is the user will be able to learn how to take care of vunerable memebrs of the community. The second will offer the user links to volunteering services and links to charities in need of support during the crisis.
the **contact info** provides links for helpline numbers and emails based on regions in Ireland aswell as the ability to write to the owners fot he website with any inquries or questions they have. 
future features we want to add include: 
                                       1) a chat feature on contact info page to help users get in touch faster and have smooth                                                     communication with site owners. 
                                       2) create a sepeate page with greater details no selected charites but time was too much of a                                                constraint this time.
## Structure
the pages are have headers with large navbar text and are hover interactive to make it as clear as possible what your clicking and what pages are available. This is to make it user friendly to members of the community who may not be comfortable on computers as some as I  feel at risk memebers of the community has a strong corrolation with the less tech savy memebers example the elderly. the footer is set up similarily. For this reason aswell clear directions on page such as on support and the banner in advice help users with in your face instructions and advice. 
## Skeleton

## Surface
Used a calmer set of colours for this page primarily as I felt the topic was stressful enough as is. A lot of white space in order to make it a little clearer for users.
