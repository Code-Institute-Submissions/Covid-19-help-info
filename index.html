                                        Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to 
                                        act as sources. For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to
                                         humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to

                                         related genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it
                                          caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten 
                                          of the people who developed SARS died. As of 24 April 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over
                                           2 668 000 cases worldwide since the first case was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more
